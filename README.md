# Weather Forecast Desktop App 

# Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App provides real-time weather information and a 5-day weather forecast for any city around the world. Users can view the current weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and the sunrise and sunset times. Additionally, the app allows users to get weather forecasts for the next five days. The app features multiple language and temperature unit options for a customized user experience.

## Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)

**Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)** is a method of assessment introduced in modern education systems. It evaluates both academic and co-curricular performance of students regularly and holistically.

### How We Applied CCE in This Project:

- **Continuous Evaluation**
  - Weekly team meetings to track progress.
  - Milestone check-ins after each development sprint.
  - Constant testing of components during implementation.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**
  - Each member contributed in various aspects: coding, design, testing, and debugging.
  - Encouraged creativity and critical thinking, especially in the UI and multilingual functionality.
  - Promoted teamwork, responsibility, and adaptability.

Through this project, we applied class concepts practically while learning how to work collaboratively, meeting deadlines and applying real-world software development processes.
